        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 pound baby red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix paprika, garlic, onion powder, Greek seasoning, sazonador total, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. 
            Reserve 1 tablespoon seasoning in a small bowl; cover and set aside until needed for the potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place remaining seasoning in a 1-gallon resealable bag with water, 4 tablespoons olive oil, and vinegar.
            Add chicken thighs; massage to coat with seasoning, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate 
            in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon reserved seasoning in a small bowl with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil;
             stir to combine. Toss potatoes in and stir until well coated. Combine potatoes and thighs in the air fryer basket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices 
            run clear, about 28 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>

    </ol>
